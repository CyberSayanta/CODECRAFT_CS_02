# 🖼️ Pixel-Based Image Encryption Tool

## 🔐 Task - 02: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

Welcome to **Code Craft Task 02**!  
This repository contains a Python-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using **basic pixel manipulation** techniques.

---

## 🧩 Project Description

This project demonstrates **image encryption** using **pixel-level operations**. The tool allows users to:
- Modify pixel values using mathematical operations
- Swap pixel positions
- Reverse the process for decryption

A simple and fun way to explore image processing and basic cryptography concepts!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Encrypts images by manipulating RGB pixel values
- 🧮 Uses simple arithmetic (e.g., shifting, inverting)
- 🔁 Supports decryption (restoring original image)
- 🖼️ Works with common formats like PNG and JPEG
- 🧑‍💻 Interactive CLI for user input

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (for image processing)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pillow

🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-image-encryption.git
cd pixel-image-encryption

2. Run the program:
python image_cipher.py

3. Follow the CLI prompts to:
Load an image

Choose encryption or decryption
